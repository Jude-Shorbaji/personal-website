            <h2> How I Made My Portfolio</h2>
            <h3> By Jude Shorbaji 10/8/24</h3>
           <p>
            I started building this website during a Rutgers Women in Computer Science Meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before the meeting, I had some experience with HTML and CSS, so I was familiar with the syntax, but creating and launching a website seemed totally foreign to me. The first thing I learned during the meeting was how to efficiently push and pull to Git Hub. It seems silly, but before this meeting, anything GitHub-related was a daunting and tedious task.

            </p>
            <p>
                While the leaders of the WICS meeting familiarized the group with HTML, I refamiliarized myself with divisions. I started to explore new CSS Syntax to make my website more visually appealing. Honestly, I find HTML and CSS quite soothing. I like being able to make easy alterations to design choices!
            </p>
            <p>I began designing the front end through a process of trial and error, which helped me figure out the best ways to display information effectively. I experimented with different color palettes, navigating the challenges of finding the right combinations. Along the way, I learned how to integrate Adobe Fonts into my project, which opened up new possibilities for enhancing the overall aesthetic. It may sound simple, but each adjustment brought me closer to creating a visually appealing and functional design, and I found the entire process quite rewarding.</p>
            <p>I have plans to continue refining my portfolio, with my next steps focused on integrating JavaScript to enhance interactivity. I also aim to ensure my portfolio is accessible across different devices, which is essential for reaching a broader audience. Additionally, I want to explore more design concepts and incorporate a dark mode, as I believe it would provide a fresh aesthetic and improve user experience. Each improvement excites me, and I look forward to the creative journey ahead.</p>
