            <h2> How I Made My Portfolio</h2>
            <h3> By Jude Shorbaji 10/8/24</h3>
           <p>
            I started building this website during a Rutgers Women in Computer Science Meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before the meeting I had some experience with HTML and CSS, so I was familiar with the syntax, but creating and
            launching a website seemed totally foreign to me. The first thing I learned during the meeting was how to 
            efficiently push and pull to github. It seems silly but prior to this meeting, anything github related was a 
            daunting and tedious task.
            </p>
            <p>
            While the leaders of the WICS meeting familiarized the group with html, I refamiliarized with divisions and
            started to explore new CSS Syntax to make my website more visually apealing. Honestly I find HTML and CSS quite
            soothing. I like being to make easy alterations to design choices!
